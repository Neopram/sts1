---

## 📋 What Was Implemented

### 1. ✅ **Frontend Components Created**

#### **A. CreateStsOperationWizard.tsx** (NEW)
- **Location:** `c:\Users\feder\Desktop\StsHub\sts\src\components\Pages\CreateStsOperationWizard.tsx`
- **Purpose:** Interactive 4-step wizard for creating STS operations
- **Features:**
  - Step 1: Basic Information (Title, Dates)
  - Step 2: Parties & Location (Country, Operation Type)
  - Step 3: Cargo Configuration (Cargo Type, Quantity, Transfer Rate)
  - Step 4: Review & Create
  - Form validation at each step
  - Professional modal UI with progress tracking
  - API integration via `ApiService.staticPost()`

#### **B. DashboardBroker.tsx** (UPDATED)
- **Location:** `c:\Users\feder\Desktop\StsHub\sts\src\components\Pages\DashboardBroker.tsx`
- **Changes:**
  - Imported `CreateStsOperationWizard`
  - Added `showCreateWizard` state
  - Changed button text to "Create New STS Operation"
  - Added icon (Plus) to button
  - Integrated wizard modal
  - Auto-refresh on successful operation creation

### 2. ✅ **Routing & Navigation**

- **Router:** `c:\Users\feder\Desktop\StsHub\sts\src\router.tsx`
  - Already has `/dashboard` route
  - Routes to `RoleDashboardSelector` component
  - Selector automatically shows appropriate dashboard based on `user.role`

### 3. ✅ **Authentication Flow**

```
User Login (admin@sts.com / password123)
    ↓
Backend: /api/v1/auth/login
    ↓
Returns: TokenResponse {
    token: "jwt-token",
    email: "admin@sts.com",
    role: "admin",
    name: "Admin User"
}
    ↓
Frontend: AppContext stores user + token
    ↓
useEffect in LoginPage triggers redirect
    ↓
navigate('/dashboard')
    ↓
RoleDashboardSelector receives user.role
    ↓
Renders appropriate dashboard:
├─ role: "admin"   → AdminDashboard
├─ role: "broker"  → DashboardBroker ← Shows STS Wizard
├─ role: "owner"   → DashboardOwner
├─ role: "seller"  → DashboardParty
├─ role: "buyer"   → DashboardParty
└─ role: "viewer"  → DashboardViewer
```

### 4. ✅ **Test Users Setup**

Created: `c:\Users\feder\Desktop\StsHub\sts\backend\create_test_users_all_roles.py`

```
✅ admin@sts.com      / password123 → Admin Dashboard
✅ broker@sts.com     / password123 → Broker Dashboard (with STS Wizard)
✅ owner@sts.com      / password123 → Owner Dashboard
✅ seller@sts.com     / password123 → Party Dashboard
✅ buyer@sts.com      / password123 → Party Dashboard
✅ viewer@sts.com     / password123 → Viewer Dashboard
```

### 5. ✅ **Backend Endpoints Working**

```
✅ POST   /api/v1/auth/login
   Returns: {token, email, role, name}

✅ POST   /api/v1/rooms
   Creates new STS operation
   Requires: title, location, sts_eta

✅ GET    /api/v1/dashboard/admin/stats
   Admin statistics (users, documents, operations)

✅ GET    /api/v1/dashboard/broker/my-rooms
   Broker's active transactions

✅ GET    /api/v1/dashboard/broker/approval-queue
   Pending approvals for broker

✅ GET    /api/v1/dashboard/owner/vessels
   Vessel owner's vessels

✅ GET    /api/v1/dashboard/owner/compliance-status
   Vessel compliance information
```

- Implement refresh token rotation
- Add request rate limiting
- Set appropriate CORS policies
- Regular security audits

**Solution:** 
1. Ensure you're logged in as broker@sts.com (role: broker)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Refresh page with Ctrl+Shift+R

### Issue: Wizard modal doesn't open
**Solution:**
1. Check browser console (F12 → Console tab)
2. Verify no JavaScript errors
3. Check network tab for API errors
4. Ensure backend is running on port 8001

### Issue: Operation not created after submitting wizard
**Solution:**
1. Check Network tab in DevTools
2. Verify POST request to /api/v1/rooms

### Issue: Wrong dashboard shown
**Solution:**
1. `localStorage.clear()` - Clear all storage
2. Log out completely
3. Close browser tab
4. Open new tab and log in again
5. Check user.role in DevTools: `JSON.stringify(window.user)`

# DAY 1 IMPLEMENTATION - NEXT STEPS & DEPLOYMENT

## üìã WHAT WAS DONE

‚úÖ **Snapshot Persistence Migration Complete**
- Created Alembic migration 003 to add snapshots table
- Rewrote snapshots.py router to use database instead of in-memory storage
- Eliminated data loss vulnerability (was: lost on restart ‚Üí now: persistent)
- Added 5-level security validation to all endpoints
- Integrated with permission matrix and audit logging

## üöÄ HOW TO DEPLOY

### Step 1: Apply Migration
```bash
cd c:\Users\feder\Desktop\StsHub\sts\backend
alembic upgrade head
```

This will:
- Create `snapshots` table
- Create 4 performance indexes
- Make snapshot data persistent

### Step 2: Verify Migration
```bash
# Check if snapshots table was created
sqlite3 sts_clearance.db ".tables"  # Should show: snapshots

# View schema
sqlite3 sts_clearance.db ".schema snapshots"
```

### Step 3: Test Snapshot Persistence
```bash
# Run the test script
python test_snapshot_persistence.py
```

Expected output:
```
‚úÖ SNAPSHOT PERSISTENCE TEST
‚úÖ Snapshot created and committed: [uuid]
‚úÖ Snapshot retrieved from database!
‚úÖ Found 1 snapshot(s) for room
‚úÖ ALL TESTS PASSED - SNAPSHOTS PROPERLY PERSISTED
```

### Step 4: Restart Server and Verify
```bash
# Terminal 1: Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
# Terminal 2: Start new server
python run_server.py

# Terminal 3: Test that snapshots survive restart
# Make a request to GET /rooms/{room_id}/snapshots
# The snapshots should still be there!
```

## üîç VALIDATION CHECKLIST

Before moving to Day 2, verify:

- [ ] Migration applied successfully: `alembic upgrade head`
- [ ] No migration errors in console
- [ ] Database schema updated (snapshots table exists)
- [ ] Test script passes: `python test_snapshot_persistence.py`
- [ ] API responds to GET /rooms/{room_id}/snapshots
- [ ] Snapshots persist after server restart
- [ ] Audit logs show snapshot actions
- [ ] Permission matrix is enforced (only admins can delete)

## üìä CURRENT STATUS

| Item | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Snapshot Persistence | ‚úÖ DONE | Uses database, not memory |
| File Migration | ‚è≥ Pending | For Day 2 |
| Real PDF Generation | ‚è≥ Pending | For Day 2 |
| Endpoint Consolidation | ‚è≥ Pending | For Day 3 |
| File Validation | ‚è≥ Pending | For Phase 2 |

## üìù DAY 2 PREVIEW: REAL PDF GENERATION

On Day 2, we will:
1. Implement PDFGenerator with ReportLab
2. Generate actual PDF files (not mock content)
3. Store PDFs in filesystem
4. Update snapshot file_url to point to real files
5. Implement async task queue for background PDF generation

### Files to Modify:
- `services/pdf_generator.py` - Implement ReportLab
- `routers/snapshots.py` - Trigger real PDF generation
- `services/storage_service.py` - Add PDF file storage
- Possibly: `requirements.txt` - Add ReportLab if not present

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT NOTES

### Breaking Changes
- Old in-memory snapshots are LOST when you apply the migration
  - This is INTENTIONAL (they were volatile anyway)
  - Production snapshots would be in database already

### Backward Compatibility
- API endpoints remain the same
- Response schema unchanged
- All existing clients continue to work

### Performance Impact
- Slight increase in latency due to database queries
- Offset by: indexes provide fast lookups
- Net result: Better performance at scale

## üêõ TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: "SQLAlchemy cannot import Snapshot"
**Solution**: Verify models.py has Snapshot class (it does)

### Issue: Migration fails with "table already exists"
**Solution**: Check if snapshots table was created manually
```bash
sqlite3 sts_clearance.db ".tables" | grep snapshots
# If exists, drop it first or use downgrade/upgrade
```

### Issue: Tests fail with "no snapshots found"
**Solution**: Ensure migration was applied: `alembic current`

### Issue: Snapshots still lost after restart
**Solution**: Verify migration applied and tables created
```bash
sqlite3 sts_clearance.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM snapshots;"
```

## üéØ SUCCESS CRITERIA

Day 1 is successful if:
1. ‚úÖ Migration applies without errors
2. ‚úÖ Snapshots table created with all columns
3. ‚úÖ Test script passes completely
4. ‚úÖ Snapshots persist after server restart
5. ‚úÖ All 5 endpoints work with database

## üìû SUPPORT

If you encounter issues:
1. Check migration status: `alembic current`
2. View migration history: `alembic history`
3. Check database schema: `sqlite3 sts_clearance.db ".schema snapshots"`
4. Review logs: Look for SQLAlchemy or database errors
5. Run test script with verbose output: `python test_snapshot_persistence.py`

**Status**: ‚úÖ DAY 1 COMPLETE - READY FOR TESTING

**Next Phase**: DAY 2 - Real PDF Generation Implementation

**Estimated Time**: 4-6 hours (depending on ReportLab learning curve)
